# Import or export a website
Devstia allows you to import or export a website for a given domain from the Quickstart menu. This feature is domain specific and includes all files and associated databases. The export process will scan all source code files in both public_html and nodeapp folders looking for database credentials to automatically bundle associated databases in the resulting export archive. 

Unlike the control panel's backup feature; this light weight portable format is not server specific. You can import an exported file to another server with a different domain name. The Devstia file format does not include email, DNS, or adjacent user website domains.
