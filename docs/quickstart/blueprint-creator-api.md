### Manifest

### Post-process Setup
devstia_setup.sh

### Auto-complete Advanced Options
If you place a devstia_setup.sh and/or a devstia_manifest.json in your /private folder, it will pre-populate the export fields for you. The result will be placed into the root of your zip archive. This allows you to keep a domain as a project with persistent settings for your export.
