# About QuickStart
QuickStart is the first thing you'll see when you login to the localhost page. Devstia contains the power and flexibility of the [Hestia Control Panel](https://hestiacp.com); but the core workflow is streamlined into three initial options that branch out into sub-options with automation to make development easier.


> - **[Create a new website](/quickstart/create-a-new-website).** *Displays an ever growing library of blueprints; pre-built website domains with options that can be filled in to further customize your creations. Associated resources such as databases and configuration files can be automatically created and scrubbed (search & replaced) with user form supplied preferences. Make your own customizable blueprints with user forms via the [Blueprint Creator API](/quickstart/blueprint-creator-api)*
> - **[Remove or copy a website](/quickstart/remove-or-copy-a-website).** *Allows you to copy or remove, in bulk, any existing website domain(s). Automatically performs source code analysis to accomodate the copying or cleanup of database dependencies and intelligently automates the updating of configuration files.*
> - **[Import or export a website](/quickstart/import-or-export-a-website)** *Imports or exports complete website domains, including associated databases by anaylizing your source code for dependencies. Future support for third-party backup file formats allow for importing from various vendors.*
